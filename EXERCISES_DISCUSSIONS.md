# ICU Prediction API: Discussion Exercises

These exercises are to be done in groups of 4. In case a certain question couldn't be answered, suggesting to proceed to the next stage are displayed like `this`.

Goals:
- Experience what it is to be part of the software product development cycle
- NOT to come up with a final software-product (although nice ideas might be a cool side effect)

Exercises:

1. Briefly investigate what sort of data is available in your organisation (5 mins). Also think of data that might be available, but is not properly stored/recorded yet.


2. Brainstorm on how data might add value to everyday life in your organisation. Try to come up with properly formulated [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) ("As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >."). Try to be come as concrete as possible! (30 mins) Suggestions are:
  - Decision support on medical questions
  - Decision support on logistical questions
  - Advanced insights


3. Congratulations, you have now defined some basic *requirements* for your software! Take (20 mins) to construct some [wireframes](https://www.experienceux.co.uk/faqs/what-is-wireframing/) that meet most (not necessarily all of them) requirements.


4. Take (10 mins) to think about practicalities regarding your software product.


5. As a final exercise, take some time (10 mins) to think about roles in your organisation. Do you know who is responsible for what? Who is in charge of the database? Who grants rights regarding those databases
